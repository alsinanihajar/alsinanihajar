## Hi there 👋  

I’m Hajar, 
Curiosity drives everything I do more than titles or roles.

- 🧠 When something doesn’t make sense, I can’t move on until I break it down and see how all the pieces connect  
- 🔍 I approach technology, data, and problem-solving by digging deep until the full picture becomes clear  
- ⚙️ I’m especially interested in logic-driven systems, human behavior, and how the brain influences the way we think and act  
- 📊 This curiosity shows up in my work, whether I’m building projects, analyzing data, or teaching others  
- 🛠️ My core tech stack includes Python, Tableau, Power BI, SQL, and web development
- 💻 I work daily with tools like Jupyter Notebook, XAMPP, and Canva  
- 🚀 I’m most motivated by challenges—when something feels difficult or unclear, that’s where I focus my energy  

**A few things about me:**  
- ☕ I love coffee  
- 📚 I’m constantly hungry for new information
- 🧩 I read about the human brain and behavior out of pure curiosity  
- 🎧 Music helps me think  
- 🍝 I enjoy cooking pasta from scratch
